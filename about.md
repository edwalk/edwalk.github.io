# Hi! I'm Ed.

I'm a 30 year old aspiring data analyst currently working in the gaming industry. Welcome to my personal blog and page.
In here, you will find a journal documenting my learning journey, some posts about different things I've figured out along the way, good resources I've come across and challenges I've run up against.
You will also find portfolio projects that I create along the way.

You can check out my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-walker-uk/).
