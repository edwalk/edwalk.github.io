## Workout Wednesday

![Portfolio image](/images/tableau.png)

As a way to expand my skills and demonstrate my Tableau problem-solving skills, I have started contributing to Workout Wednesday, a global community with new Tableau-related challenges released every Wednesday.

As an introduction, I have begun working through the Workout Wednesday Essentials series, a set of useful challenges for people new to the community.

As I continue to contribute to this, you will find my Workout Wednesday solutions on my [Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edward.walker3149/vizzes)

In this spin off project, I take some of the data from the queries above and create a small visualisation that allows people to compare major statistics across the decades in F1 (winners, racers, race numbers, points scorers, standings & points progression throughout individual seasons).

You can find the visualisation here: [F1 Through The Decades](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edward.walker3149/viz/F1ThroughtheDecades/Decades#4)
