In order to focus solely on practicing SQL and Tableau visualisations, I downloaded a new dataset regrouping all international rugby results since 1871: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lylebegbie/international-rugby-union-results-from-18712022).

The dataset includes the following columns:

* Date
* Home Team
* Away Team
* Home Score
* Away Score
* Competition
* Stadium
* City
* Country
* Neutral (was the game played in a neutral venue, true or false)
* World Cup (was the game a world cup game, true of false)

I've created a new private repository and started adding some very basic SQL queries I'm using to explore the dataset. You can find this here: [Github](https://github.com/edwalk/rugby-internationals-results)

I will continue to explore the dataset in the coming days and start writing increasingly complex SQL queries to start surfacing some fun and interesting statistics.
