title: An update & 100 Days of Python
tags: python
---

Hello,

It's been a while since I've updated this page. I've since secured my first role as a Business Intelligence Analyst at the company I work at, and it has been a daily learning curve to develop new skills and adapt my personal learning to a professional environment. This has meant that I've had little time (and energy) for my personal projects.

To try and fix this, I've started the 100 Days of Python course over on Udemy. I've completed the first day today and, while the content was not particularly challenging for someone with programming basics and some experience with Python, I'm keen to work through the content until I start reaching some of the more challenging topics further down the course. It seems like it covers quite a bit, with some projects aimed at building things I've been interested in building previously so I'll keep updating this blog every day as a way to keep myself accountable for progress.

If you're looking for a simple band name generator, here is my code for the day 1 project:


print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
print("What city did you grow up in?")
city_name = input()
print("What is the name of your pet?")
pet_name = input()
band_name = city_name + " " + pet_name
print("Your band name could be: " + band_name)
input()
