I continued to explore the SofaSport API to see what was available for rugby union statistics.

I created 4 additional functions that connected to various SofaSport endpoints and extracted .json datasets:
* Sports categories (for rugby, this is rugby union, rugby league, rugby sevens)
* Tournament list for a specific sports category
* Seasons list for a specific tournament
* A list of rounds for a specific tournament and season
* Events for a specific tournament and season (matches)

I found a number of other endpoints that could contain valuable data, including the Statistics, Sub-Events and Incidents endpoints that seem to provide a more detailed breakdown of in-game statistics for a specific event (or game).

I unfortunately hit a blocker when I realised that Tableau Public does not accept JSON files. The files themselves were structured in such a way that prevented easy conversion to CSV, and I decided that the time needed to understand how to manipulate the JSON file into something that Tableau could process may be better spent elsewhere for now as I try to practice SQL and data visualisation skills.

I will continue to explore this project as a side project while I focus on building a solid SQL and visualisation portfolio.
