Hello again world!

After reconsidering my progress with my own portfolio website, I have decided to migrate to a jekyll blog. As I work to develop my own data analytics skills and build a portfolio, I was finding that also learning to develop a reasonable website to host all of this activity in was becoming too time consuming. Using a lightweight platform such as jekyll, that can run effectively on GitHub pages, I grant myself more time to focus on what I really need to focus on: data visualisations and analysis.

You'll find more posts here as I document my progress, and I'll look to add additional pages in the coming weeks.

Welcome back!
