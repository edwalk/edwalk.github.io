As part of my ongoing work to improve my Tableau skills, I've produced a small spin off visualisation based on some of the F1 data SQL queries I've practiced writing (see my portfolio page).

The visualisation was my first attempt to systematically use vertical and horizontal containers to shape the dashboard precisely, as opposed to letting Tableau put together solely on the basis of drag and drop. The end result is inspired by another visualisation I saw on Tableau Public and provides the following information:

* Number of unique races per selected decade/year(s)
* Number of unique racers
* Number of point scorers
* Number of winners
* Standings (constructors & drivers)
* Points progression per single season.

You can find the visualisation here: [F1 Through the Decades](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edward.walker3149/viz/F1ThroughtheDecades/Decades#4)
